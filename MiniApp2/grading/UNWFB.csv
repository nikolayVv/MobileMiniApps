1,The code compiled from the first try,1,1,
2,"The code did no compile initially, but was fixed with minor corrections / changes",0,-1,
,MAIN ACTIVITY,,,
3,"Does the app contain all three components: MainActivity, MediaPlayerService and AccelerationService?",1,1,
4,"Does the MainActivity layout contain the commands: play, pause, stop, exit, gesturesOn and gesturesOff?",1,1,
5,"Are the following commands executed properly through the MainActivity: play, pause and stop?",1,3,"The only problem is that when a song is playing and the user press ""Play"", it doesn’t start a  new song but it pauses the current one, but everything else is okay"
6,Are the following commands executed properly through the MainActivity: gesturesOn and gesturesOff?,1,2,
7,Is the following command executed properly through the MainActivity: exit?,1,1,
8,"Does the MainActivity layout displays correct track title, duration information and progress bar (e.g., receives updates every second)?",1,1,
9,Is the progress bar implemented using coroutines?,1,1,
10,Does to MainActivity use a Binder to connect to the MediaPlayerService?,1,1,
,MEDIA_PLAYER_SERVICE,,,
11,Is the MediaPlayerService implemented as a foreground service?,1,1,
12,"Does the MediaPlayerService notification allow the commands: play, pause, stop and exit? (it is OK if there are only three visible at a time )",1,1,
13,"Are the following commands executed properly through MediaPlayerService notification: play, pause and stop?",1,3,
14,"Does the MediaPlayerService notification displays correct track title and duration information (e.g., receives updates every second)?",1,2,It doesn't show the photo of the current song
15,Is the track title and duration information equal both in the MainActivity and in the foreground notification after closing and re-opening the MainActivity? ,1,2,
,ACCELERATION_SERVICE,,,
16,Is the AccelerationService implemented as a Service?,1,1,
17,Does the AccelerationService read data from the phone's Accelerometer sensor?,1,1,
18,"Does the AccelerationService contain gesture-recognition algorithm for recognizing IDLE vs. HORIZONTAL vs. VERTICAL ? (mark 1, even if it does not function completely properly)",1,1,
,"Using the emulator, with the app runing and MainActivity active, perform several random gestures (HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL) in a row with a few seconds pause in between.",,,

,BONUS TASK,,,
24,"Does the app contain code for the Bonus task (e.g., significant amount of code not required for the main part of the application)",0,2,Bonus task not implemented
25,"Does the app allow to train a machine learning model for user-defined gesture recognition (mark 1, even if it does not function completely properly)",0,2,Bonus task not implemented
26,"Does the app include the pre-trained model and a ""gestures.txt"" file describing the two gestures the model was trained on?",0,2,Bonus task not implemented
27,Did the pre-trained app successfully recognize user's gestures?,0,2,Bonus task not implemented
28,"Is the following statement true: ""The app did not crash while I was testing the Bonus task""",0,2,Bonus task not implemented
